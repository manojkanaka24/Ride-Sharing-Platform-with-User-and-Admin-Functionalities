# Ride-Sharing Platform with User and Admin Functionalities

## Overview

This project aims to build a comprehensive ride-sharing platform with three distinct user roles: Traveler, Traveler Companion, and Admin. The platform facilitates ride sharing, tracking, notifications, and feedback sharing between users and admin.

## Features

### Traveler

- **Share Ride Details:**
  - Share ride details through WhatsApp or SMS.
  - Expire the link automatically after the trip is complete.

- **Review Audit Trail:**
  - Users can review the audit trail of the rides they have shared.

### Traveler Companion

- **Track Ride:**
  - Real-time tracking of the traveler's ride.

- **Trip Completion Notification:**
  - Receive a notification when the traveler's trip is complete.

- **Nearby Notification:**
  - Get notified when the cab approaches the geofence of the traveler's drop location.

- **Feedback Sharing:**
  - Share the feedback of the ride experience with the Admin.

### Admin

- **View All Rides:**
  - Access to view all the rides shared by users.

- **Experience Feedback:**
  - View the overall experience feedback provided by users.

## Authentication

Implement robust user authentication protocols to ensure secure access to the platform.

## Scalability Strategies

Propose scalable strategies to accommodate an expanding user base, considering time and space complexity in the system.

## Cost Estimation

Conduct a thorough analysis of time and space complexity, utilizing efficient algorithms and data structures for optimized performance.

## Fault-Tolerance and System Failure Cases

Implement fault-tolerant mechanisms, backup and recovery strategies, and comprehensive error recovery procedures to address system failures.

## Object-Oriented Programming Language (OOPS)

Choose a robust OOPS language, applying principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for maintainability and extensibility.

## Trade-offs in the System

Clearly define and document trade-offs made during system design, considering performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## System Monitoring

Implement comprehensive monitoring tools, real-time dashboards, and logging mechanisms to track system performance and promptly address issues.

## Caching

Integrate caching mechanisms for enhanced system response times, reducing database load, and implementing cache eviction policies for optimal resource utilization.

## Error and Exception Handling

Develop a robust error and exception handling framework, providing meaningful error messages for effective debugging. Regularly review and update error-handling strategies based on system usage patterns.
